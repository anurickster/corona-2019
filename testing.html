            <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 33px; text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: Medical experts from around the world estimate that a coronavirus vaccine could be developed in as many as 12-18 months. However, past experiences have shown that the much-awaited vaccine could take years to develop.
                <br> <br>
                With COVID-19 infection crossing the 19 million mark and fatalities topping 7,00,000 mark, steady research and development of vaccines are fast emerging as the ray of hope during the pandemic. WHO, in its latest briefing, also said that ensuring easy availability of vaccines could pave way for faster global recovery, with Dr Anthony Fauci optimistically expecting tens of millions of vaccine doses by early 2021. A lot of promising developments have been made, even as experts debate who will get access to a COVID-19 vaccine first.
               <br> <br> The development cycle of a vaccine consists of six stages â€” Exploratory stage, Pre-clinical stage, Clinical development, Regulatory review and approval and Manufacturing Quality control.</p>
            <div class="paragraph">
            <h6>Exploratory Phase</h6>
            <p>This stage involves basic laboratory research and could last for 2-4 years. Scientists identify natural and synthetic antigens. Research is an extensive process that requires years to secure funding, get approvals and study results piece by piece.
                <br> <br> However, in the current scenario, when the entire world is in the grip of novel coronavirus, countries and health organisations have all put their weight behind fast-tracking the vaccine programme.
                <br> <br> Currently, over 250 therapies and 95 vaccines related to coronavirus are being explored.
                <br> <br> The idea is to have as many hits as possible with the hope that at least some or one would succeed.</p>
            
                <h6>Pre-clinical stage</h6>
                <p>The vaccine developed in the research phase is tested on animals such as mice and monkeys to see if it produces an immune response. The pre-clinical stage, in normal circumstances, lasts for at least 1-2 years.</p>
                <p>The scientists try to calibrate the cellular response vaccine would have on humans.</p>
                <p>In this stage, safe dosage and ways to administer a vaccine are determined.</p>
                <p>In this stage, the scientist can also do 'challenge studies', meaning they would vaccinate and animal and then try to infect it with the pathogen to verify the results.</p>

                </div>
                <h6>Clinical development</h6>
                <p>Clinical development phase consists of three sub-phases in which vaccine is tested on a different number of humans. This is also the phase where the majority of promising potential vaccines fail.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>PHASE I :</b> Phase I trial is performed on a limited number of humans, 20 to 100 healthy volunteers with conditions that a vaccine can treat. Phase I assess the safety of the candidate vaccine and also tries to determine the "type and extent" of immune response that it provokes. Generally, phase I trials take two months to complete.</p>
                <p><b>PHASE II :</b> In this phase, a candidate vaccine is tested on several hundred people. In this phase, the people are segregated according to their age to determine the impact of the vaccine on different age groups. Like Phase I, in this phase too, the scientists try to determine a vaccine's safety and its ability to provoke the immune system.</p>
                <p><b>PHASE III :</b> In this phase, thousands of people are vaccinated. Scientists wait to see how many people are infected compared to people who received a placebo.
                    In this phase, scientists also try to determine any random side effects of the vaccine. This is the final step before a candidate vaccine is approved for public use.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;">"The combined efforts with the team at Codagenix have borne fruit and we hope to save millions of lives with this vaccine," he said.</p>
