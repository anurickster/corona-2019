                    <p><span><b>PRINCIPLE TESTING</b></span><b> : </b> Scientists test a new vaccine on cells and then give it to animals such as mice or monkeys to see if it produces an immune response. We have confirmed 91 preclinical vaccines in active development.</p>
                    <p><span style="background-color: rgba(3, 138, 104, 0.733);">PHASE 1 SAFETY TRAIL</span><b> : </b> Scientists give the vaccine to a small number of people to test safety and dosage as well as to confirm that it stimulates the immune system.</p>
                    <p><span style="background-color: rgb(36, 141, 182);">PHASE 2 EXPANDED TRAIL</span><b> : </b> Scientists give the vaccine to hundreds of people split into groups, such as children and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. These trials further test the vaccineâ€™s safety and ability to stimulate the immune system.</p>
                    <p><span style="background-color: rgb(46, 170, 179);">PHASE 2 EFFICACY TRAIL</span><b> : </b>  Scientists give the vaccine to thousands of people and wait to see how many become infected, compared with volunteers who received a placebo. These trials can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus. In June, the F.D.A. said that a coronavirus vaccine would have to protect at least 50% of vaccinated people to be considered effective. In addition, Phase 3 trials are large enough to reveal evidence of relatively rare side effects that might be missed in earlier studies.</p>
                    <p><span style="background-color: rgb(89, 87, 206);">EARLY OR LIMITED APPROVAL</span><b> : </b>  China and Russia have approved vaccines without waiting for the results of Phase 3 trials. Experts say the rushed process has serious risks.</p>
                    <p><span style="background-color: rgb(179, 179, 179);">APPROVED</span><b> : </b> Regulators in each country review the trial results and decide whether to approve the vaccine or not. During a pandemic, a vaccine may receive emergency use authorization before getting formal approval. Now Vaccine has been Licensed and Reasearchers can Continue to Monitor People Who will receive it.</p>
